- Started Working on the Game Setup Screen
- Completed the Design of the Game Setup Screen (Start Button doesn't work yet)
- You can Change the Color of the Player

19 July (Day 3)

- The Start Button Now Works
- Started Working on the Main Game Screen
- The Player Can Now Move in All Directions and It Can Only Move in the Visible Area of the Screen

20 July (Day 4)
- The Player Can Now Shoot Bullets in the Front Direction
- The Enemy Spawn and Come Towards the Player and on Colliding with Player It gets Destroyed and Player's lives are Reduced by 1 BUT the Game Crashes. So, Working on Another Solution
- Removed the Feature to Change the Color of The  Player Temporarily. I will Add it back in Future and the Player won't have to choose the Color of the Player Everytime the Game Starts, It Will Have a Different Settings Menu which will Include Other Settings too Where the Color of the Player can also be Changed.

21 July (Day 5)
- PROBLEMS! PROBLEMS! PROBLEMS! I tried but couldn't solve the problems today
- Putting a hold on this project for now as it turns out i need to learn more. so i will be back after learning more and  complete this project or make it from scratch again.

22 July (Day 6)
- Gonna Start Working on the Game Tomorrow Again
- Because I Just Might be able to complete it (Tech With Tim Pygame Tutorial)

23 July (Day 7)
- AAAAANNNNNDDDD......The Problem is Fixed Now
- The Collision Detection works Perfectly and the Game Does not Crash Nor does it even Lag which is Great
- Added Scores and Lives Counter, When Lives is 0, it doesn't do anything yet, but i will add the game over screen tomorrow
- Also i decided that the enemies won't go towards the player and i have no LOGICAL explanation for that but i think if i kept it that way the game would eventually become harder so i guess i made the correct choice. Now, the enemies only go in straight direction.

24 July (Day 8)
- So Today i implemented the Game Over Text, when the player's lives reaches 0, it will show the text and get back to the main menu
- But the problem is i want the game to pause for like 3-4 seconds during which time it will show the game over text and get back to main menu which is not happening right now so i will do that tomorrow

25 July (Day 9)
- Fixed the Game Over Screen today, which will show the game over text for 5 seconds when the player's lives reaches zero AND i have made a little change, now after the player dies it won't go back to the main menu screen instead it will just quit the game now.
- Also TODAY I COMPLETED ALL THE WORK ON THE GAME (v0.1) (CHEERS!!!)

26 July (Day 10)

28 July (Day 11)
